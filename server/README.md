# Flask Server

This is a Flask application for prediction.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Open a terminal navigate to the root of the project and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (replace 'myenv' with your preferred name)
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the project dependencies using pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
